# Senate Insights: High-Level Overview and User Flow

## Objective
Develop a web application, **Senate Insights**, that collects public concerns and feedback from multiple sources (Twilio for calls/SMS and Gmail for emails), processes the data, and presents it in an organized insights dashboard. This platform aims to make community feedback visible and actionable through structured data representation and analysis.

## Key Components and Workflow

### 1. Data Collection and Sources
- **Twilio**:  
  - Set up a public phone number for users to call or SMS. Calls and SMS will capture user-submitted concerns or inquiries.
- **Gmail API**:
  - Connect to a designated Gmail account (`haloweaveinsights@gmail.com`) to import concerns sent via email.
  
### 2. Data Storage and Structuring
- **Database Design**:
  - Store all incoming data (SMS, phone transcriptions, emails) efficiently. Each entry will include metadata: source (phone/SMS/email), timestamp, and contact information (if available).
- **Data Processing**:
  - Run automated AI categorization on raw text data to identify themes, categories, and sentiments (e.g., complaints, suggestions, inquiries).
  - Maintain high data quality and redundancy handling to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the structured data.
- **Structure Output for Dashboard**:
  - Format the processed data into structured tables or JSON that feeds into a front-end dashboard.

### 3. Dashboard and Data Visualization
- **User Interface**:
  - Create an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard that highlights key insights (popular concerns, trends, sentiment analysis, etc.).
  - Allow filtering by data source, category, or date for targeted insights.
- **Data Sharing via API**:
  - Optional: Offer a secure API endpoint for third-party access, authenticated by a secret key, to allow external applications to retrieve structured data.

### 4. Future Considerations
- Optimize data storage for scaling and efficient data retrieval.
- Design the system with flexibility for further categorization and advanced analytics as the data volume grows.
