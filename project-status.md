## Testing Notes

### SMS Testing

```bash
# Send a test SMS to:
+1 443-843-0495

# Expected Flow:
1. Message received by Twilio.
2. Message forwarded to our webhook endpoint.
3. Message stored in the database.
4. AI analysis is triggered.
5. Response generated and sent back (currently timing out).
```

### Voice Testing (Pending)

```bash
# Place a call to:
+1 443-843-0495

# Expected Flow:
1. Greeting message is played.
2. Caller leaves a message which is recorded.
3. Recording is forwarded to our webhook endpoint.
4. Recording is stored and transcribed.
5. AI analysis is performed on the transcription.
```

## Environment Setup

```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+14438430495
```

- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly.
- **Update Twilio Webhook URLs:**

  - **Production Webhooks (Vercel):**
    - SMS: `https://get-civic.vercel.app/api/webhooks/twilio/sms`
    - Voice: `https://get-civic.vercel.app/api/webhooks/twilio/voice`

  - **Development Webhooks (Local with ngrok):**
    - SMS: `https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/twilio/sms`
    - Voice: `https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/twilio/voice`

- Verify webhook URLs are updated in the Twilio console accordingly.

## Development Pipeline

### Local Testing with ngrok

- **Expose Local Server:**

  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```

- **Update Twilio Webhook URLs to ngrok URL:**

  - SMS Webhook URL: `https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/twilio/sms`
  - Voice Webhook URL: `https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/twilio/voice`

- **Testing Steps:**
  - Monitor incoming messages and calls via the Twilio console.
  - Check database entries for correct data storage.
  - Verify AI analysis is triggered and logs are generated.

### Production Deployment on Vercel

- **Deploy Latest Changes:**
  - Push updates to the main branch.
  - Vercel will automatically deploy the latest changes.

- **Set Environment Variables in Vercel:**

  - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
  - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
  - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`

- **Update Twilio Webhook URLs to Production:**

  - SMS Webhook URL: `https://get-civic.vercel.app/api/webhooks/twilio/sms`
  - Voice Webhook URL: `https://get-civic.vercel.app/api/webhooks/twilio/voice`

- **Post-Deployment Checks:**
  - Monitor application logs for errors and performance issues.
  - Track response times and optimize as needed.
